[CRASH COURSE]
The lesson is going to show the rational behind using ANTLR4: 

Refer to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation Book 
- g4 file: 
    - Grammar specs
    - Tokens 

- ANTLR will generate: 
    (w/ visiter option)
    - parser            } Java class
    - Lexer             } Java class
    - Visiter:          } Java class
    - Listener:         } Java class 
I might use another java classes that I utilize the parser/lexer/visiter/listener (e.g. AST class that I need to develop)
