- Program the AST 
- Program the computation of the robustness 



As for 9.22.22: 
- Debug the computation of robustness: 
    - Formulate a feasible example to test upon  
    - AND and OR operators 
- TWTL-RRT* 
    - Modify the STL-RRT* code and test it (No automaton whatsoever)
    - Think about how the language guided work and use that alongside with maximizing the robustness
    - How PFSA could help? How the predicated guards would work in your case? 
- Create the Syntax/Semantics for wTWTL
    - Update the grammar file
