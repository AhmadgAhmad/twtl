When Arriving to a hold operator: 
- It's best to create a class in which the threshold, the variable 
of the predicates are part of the attributes. 
- We need to extract the values once and for all when producing 
the AST. 

pred = ctx.children[3]
pred_variable = lin_pred.children[0].children[0].symbol.text
pred_relation = lin_pred.children[1].symbol.text
pred_threshold = float(lin_pred.children[2].children[0].symbol.text)
